# Ruby Assessment - Day 2

Fork this repository, and clone the fork to your local computer. Edit this README.md file to contain the answers, and then make a pull request on Github to turn in the assessment.

## Question 1

a = 4
b = 4

"b" has been stated as 4 and has not been changed.
"a" has been re-stated to be equal to the value of "b"

## Question 2

e = 3
f = 9
g = 12

"e" has been stated as being equal to 3, at the beginning and end of the list. "f" is stated as being equal to 9 and then is mentioned in a boolean statement where its value is not changed. "g" is equal to the sum of "e" and "f".

## Question 3

weather = "cloudy" is declaring a variable. In the program weather now represents "cloudy".
weather == "cloudy" is a compartive statement or boolean. This would compute as false because weather is not the same as "cloudy".

## Question 4

The output would be "sushi is delicious" because x is not 3, it is 2, and therefore greater than 0 (as in the esif statement).

## Question 5

The output would be "I'm allergic!" because, in this case, food has been declared as a variable equal to "walnut" and in the if statement the condition reads as true since "walnut" is the same as "walnut".
