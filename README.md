# Ruby Assessment - Day 2

Fork this repository, and clone the fork to your local computer. Edit this README.md file to contain the answers, and then make a pull request on Github to turn in the assessment.

## Question 1

```ruby
a = 5
b = 4
a = b
```

At the end of this program, what are the values of a and b? Try to explain, in plain English, how you got your answer for each one.

a and b = 4 . Value for a is replaced with the value of b

## Question 2

```ruby
e = 3
f = 9
g = e + f
f == g
e = 3
```

At the end of this program, what are the values of e, f, and g? Try to explain, in plain English, how you got your answer for each one.

e = 3 (last expression for e)
f = false (boolean expression g = 12 f previously = 9)
g = 12

## Question 3

```ruby
weather = "cloudy"
weather == "cloudy"
```

What is the difference between these two statements? Explain your answer.

first statement sets variable = weather
second statement evaluates whether weather is equivalent to cloudy

## Question 4

```ruby
x = 2

if x == 3
  puts "sushi is tasty"
elsif x > 0
  puts "sushi is delicious"
end
```

Imagine that you take the code from this question, save it to a file called `sushi.rb`, and run `ruby sushi.rb` in your Terminal.

What would be the output? Explain your answer.

output would be 'sushi is delicious' as x != 3 but is greater than 0

## Question 5

```ruby
food = "walnut"

if food == "walnut"
  puts "I'm allergic!"
end
```

Imagine that you take the code from this question, save it to a file called `snack.rb`, and run `ruby snack.rb` in your Terminal.

What would be the output? Explain your answer.

'I'm allergic!' as food is equivalent to walnut
